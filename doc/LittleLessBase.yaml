              Basic protocol features like compatibility version check or echo service.

      shortName:      ver
      longName:       Version
      sinceVersion:   1
      supportedTypes:
                      - '>'

                      Exchange supported application name and supported protocol version.

                      No other commands should be send before a version was exchanged.
                      If application name from other side differs or an incompatible version was received no further communication should take place.
                      Of course new Version commands are still allowed.

                      A Version request ('>') must be answered with a Version result ('<').
                      A Version update ('#') will be send after internal version changes. Such a change may be triggered by application.

                      Echoservice to check if the other side is sill there.

                      A Echo request ('>') must be answered with a Echo result ('<').
                      All data from the request must be copied to the result.
